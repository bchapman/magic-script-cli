## npm package name


Also we have the `@magic-script` namespace and can use that.  I prefer this route

- `@magic-script/tool` - cli tool
- `@magic-script/runtime` - framework

## binary

- `magic-script` - main cli tool name
- `mxs` - as optional short version

## github name

`magic-script/magic-script-cli` - we repeat the full name so that forks still have "magic-script" in the name.

## english name

MagicScript - The overarching project
MagicScript Command Line Tool - the command-line tool.
